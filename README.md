# JavaScript-form-validation-against-JS-injections

JavaScript form validation with form common checks and also structures against dangerous JS potential injections. It also counts with JS modules implementation and custom exception classes to handle errors.

So... can you break the code? If you can, let me know ;)

## Locations: 

You can find the files in WebContent directory.

* Exceptions: it contains classes and subclasses for exception handling.
* Validations: script files for checks on login and register in the browser.
* Current directory: jsp files for index and register. 

A larger JSP MVC Java application comes after this. Just on production yet...

**Don't doubt to comment or express your opinion on how to improve the code. I would be thankful if you could also share it! Thankx!!**
