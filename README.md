# JavaScript-form-validation-against-JS-injections
JavaScript form validation with form common checks and also structures against dangerous JS potential injections. It also counts with JS modules implementation and custom exception classes to handle errors.

## Locations: 

You can find the files in WebContent directory.

* Exceptions: it contains classes and subclasses for exception handling.
* Validations: script files for checks on login and register in the browser.
* Current directory: jsp files for index and register. 

A larger JSP MVC Java application comes after this. Just on production yet...
